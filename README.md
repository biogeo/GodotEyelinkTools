# Behavioral research tools for Godot

Godot is a promising platform for behavioral research, leveraging the advantages
of a modern game engine to remove a lot of the hard work of programming a
complex virtual environment, leaving the researcher free to focus on task design
and scientific questions. To fully take advantage of its potential, however, a
certain amount of basic infrastructure for running behavioral tasks and
interfacing with specialized hardware used in research needs to be available.
This project aims to fill that gap.

This project is composed of several interrelated addons for Godot. All of them
or a subset can be installed, as needed.

Note: this project is currently an early work-in-progress and may not function
correctly or at all! Use at your own risk, and contributions are welcome.
